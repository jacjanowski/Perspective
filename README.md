# Project 3: Perspective
> _By Alex Woo & Jacob Janowski_


## Description

This project takes the completed Project 2 and adds more desgin and tools in order to create an upgraded version with its own adaptation. In this project, there will be 3 types of scenes in which will be accessible for the user to go into:
- Dancing on the Ceiling
- Land of the Giants
- Mego Playset

Each scene will have its own specific goals and implementations that aren't connected to one another. The user will be able to transition between the scenes using a menu system which has been incorporated into each scene. 

## Capabilities

The user will have a lot of freedom to do as they wish within each of the scenes that they enter. Each scene will be designated on focusing on the overall intent of what that scene will serve the user. More on this below.

### Dancing on the Ceiling

This scene allows for the user to be able to rotate themselves into whichever direction they choose. For example, by clicking on one of the buttons that is displayed within the scene, the user will be able to 'walk' on the wall or ceiling depending on which way they choose. All models that are in the scene will be affected by gravity, meaning if you place yourself upside down, all models will fall to the ground.

### Land of the Giants

The main focus of this scene was to incorporate 20 new models and have half of them be interactable to the user, which in this scene is 1 foot tall in height. Everything appears to be very large in the user's eyes. With this, there are small things respective to the user's height that allows certain things to be interactable. They are able to walk up and down the tables that have these objects, and are able to do everything else normally in this scene.

### Mego Playset

Starting off outside the building, the user will take the original building with all the models in it from project 2 and minimize it to a doll house size. All the models within the building are also shruken. There are 4 dolls with animations next to the playhouse which allows the user to be able to pick them up and place them within the building. The user can take off the roof of the playhouse and place them inside. Moreover, there is a flashlight that will allow a user to turn it on and off and point it within the playhouse for better examination.
